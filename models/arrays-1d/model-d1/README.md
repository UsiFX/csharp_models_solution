# Model D1

## Problem
Print reversed elements greater than 20.

## Input
Array of 9 integers (e.g., 50 45 40 35 30 25 20 15 10)

## Output
Elements greater than 20, printed in reverse order (e.g., 50 45 40 35 30 25)

## Logic
1. Read 9 integers into an array
2. Iterate through the array from the last index to the first (reverse order)
3. For each element:
   - If the element is greater than 20, print it
4. Print all qualifying elements in a single line

## How to Run

```bash
make run topic=arrays-1d model=d1
