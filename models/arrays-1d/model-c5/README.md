# Model C5

## Problem
Copy elements at odd indices into a new array.

## Input
Array of 10 integers.

## Output
New array containing only elements from odd indices (1, 3, 5, 7, 9), printed in one line.

## Logic
1. Read 10 integers into an array
2. Create a new array to store elements from odd indices
3. Iterate through the array:
   - If index is odd (index % 2 == 1), add element to new array
4. Print the new array in one line

## How to Run

```bash
make run topic=arrays-1d model=c5
```
