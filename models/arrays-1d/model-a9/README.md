# Model A9

## Problem
Print elements located at even indices from a 10-element array.

## Input
Array of 10 integers.

## Output
Elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, 6, 8), printed in one line.

## Logic
1. Read 10 integers into an array
2. Iterate through the array with index from 0 to 9
3. Check if the index is even (index % 2 == 0)
4. If even, print the element
5. Print all qualifying elements in a single line

## How to Run

```bash
make run topic=arrays-1d model=a9
```
