# Model A3

## Problem
Modify elements in a value range and compute their sum.

## Input
Array of 6 integers.

## Output
- Sum of modified elements
- Final modified array

## Logic
1. Read 6 integers into an array
2. Iterate through the array:
   - If element is between 15 and 25 (inclusive), increase it by 2
   - Add the modified value to a running sum
3. Print the sum of modified elements
4. Print the final modified array

## How to Run

```bash
make run topic=arrays-1d model=a3
```
