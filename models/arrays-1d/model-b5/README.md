# Model B5

## Problem
Element-wise sum of two arrays (length 3).

## Input
- First array of 3 integers
- Second array of 3 integers

## Output
Third array where each element is the sum of corresponding elements from the two input arrays.

## Logic
1. Read the first array of 3 integers
2. Read the second array of 3 integers
3. Create a third array to store results
4. For each index i from 0 to 2:
   - result[i] = array1[i] + array2[i]
5. Print the resulting array

## How to Run

```bash
make run topic=arrays-1d model=b5
```
