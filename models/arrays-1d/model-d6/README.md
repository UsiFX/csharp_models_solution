## Problem
Print elements divisible by 6.

## Input
Array of 8 integers.

## Output
Elements that are divisible by both 2 and 3 (i.e., divisible by 6).

## Logic
1. Read 8 integers into an array
2. Iterate through each element:
   - Check if element % 6 == 0 (divisible by 6)
   - If true, print the element
3. Print all qualifying elements

## How to Run

```bash
make run topic=arrays-1d model=d6
```
