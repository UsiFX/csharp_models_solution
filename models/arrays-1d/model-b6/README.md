# Model B6

## Problem
Print sqrt for numbers divisible by 3.

## Input
Array of 6 integers.

## Output
Square roots of elements divisible by 3.

## Logic
1. Read 6 integers into an array
2. Iterate through each element:
   - Check if element % 3 == 0 (divisible by 3)
   - If true, calculate and print Math.Sqrt(element)
3. Print the square roots of qualifying elements
